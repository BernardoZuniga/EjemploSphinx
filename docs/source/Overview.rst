Overview
=====

We expand the first version of the OSeMOSYS-CR model [1] with three objectives:

- First, we add a representation of the energy transformation technological
  chain in the industrial sector, i.e., the collection of firms that consume
  energy to manufacture goods. Previously, only the energy supply and transport
  sectors were included.
- Second, we reformulate the model to link it to gross domestic product (GDP)
  growth as the driver of end-use energy and transport demands.
- Third, we present a toolset to flexibly create the model and multiple
  scenarios under the OSeMOSYS paradigm.

OSeMOSYS is a bottom-up Energy System Optimization Model (ESOM) platform that supports
long-term energy planning [2]â€“[4]. OSeMOSYS-CR [1] is the ESOM used to inform
the cost-benefit analysis [5] of Costa Rica's National Decarbonization Plan [6].
The OSeMOSYS-CR-v2 model version has supporting Python-based software programs
that facilitate the creation, parameterization, and analysis of multiple scenarios.
Figure 1 shows the interaction of the supporting software programs designed to
work on Windows operation systems and the GLPK OSeMOSYS implementation.

The two major components of the toolset are:

A. Building of bottom-up techno-economic model structure and input
   parameterization: It comprises Microsoft Excel files containing inputs
   for ``A1_Mode_Structure.py`` and ``A2_Compiler.py``, which create all the
   necessary model sets, connections, and adequate parameterization for a
   Business-as-Usual scenario, i.e., a scenario without energy transformations.

B. Scenario configuration: contains Microsoft Excel files indicating parameter
   changes performed by ``B1_Base_Scenarios.py`` to model scenarios with energy
   system transformation, execute OSeMOSYS, and obtain results files. 

There is an additional processing stage in ``B2_Results_Creator_f0.py``, which
converts all input and output data into two comma-separated files
(inputs and outputs) for convenient data visualization.

We explain OSeMOSYS-CR-v2 in four sections for a step-by-step setup and
scenario creation guide:

1.	The :ref:`model structure <chapter-ModelStructure>` section shows the
technological options we model.

2. The :ref:`parameterization <chapter-Parameterization>` section elaborates on
the assumptions and data inputs, including exogenous demand equations.

3. The :ref:`scenario modeling <chapter-ScenarioModeling>` section shows the
tool component to create the multiple scenarios in "Prioritizing policy
options to transform energy systems: aligning decarbonization and production
sophistication in Costa Rica."

4. The :ref:`OSEMOSYS-CR-v2 execution guide <chapter-OSeMOSYS-CR-v2-execution-guide>`
describes the modeling process in simple steps. It also contains the Python
packages to execute the scripts.
