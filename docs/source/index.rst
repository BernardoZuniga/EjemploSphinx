Â¡Welcome to OSeMOSYS-CR v2!
===================================
.. class:: justify
This repository is the online documentation for the OSeMOSYS-CR model version
used in the research article *"Prioritizing policy options to transform energy
systems: aligning decarbonization and production sophistication in Costa Rica"*.

<div style="text-align: justify">
Additionally, with Python-based programs for model and scenario creation, we
provide a toolset to accelerate the model production stage of the analysis
and reach the insight generation stage quickly. Finally, we elaborate on the
data sources and assumptions used to parametrize the model version for
the research paper mentioned above.
